# Humane Side of CivicDataLab

---

## Openness

<p>As Aaron Swartz popularly said, <code>A piece of knowledge, unlike a piece of physical property, can be shared by large groups of people without making anybody poorer.</code> At CivicDataLab, we exercise Openness as core to our work and encourage our partners to collaborate in Open as well. We are committed to sharing our learnings and failures to grow together. We believe that our world can become a much better place if we start thinking and working in Open.</p>

## Diversity and Inclusivity

<p>We believe diversity is the only thing we should have in common as a group. With a diverse team and inclusive environment, we endeavor to think and act independently together while creating a safe working culture. We advocate the same in our projects, domains, technologies and more. We promote a culture where everyone irrespective of their uniqueness work and grows together.</p>


## Feedbacks

<p>We understand feedback is powerful as it serves as a guide to assist people to know how they and others perceive their performance. We regularly exchange feedback among partner organisations, communities and other people we work with. It helps us achieve more collaboration and explore new opportunities. We also practice effective listening and proactive communication as they are essential for effective problem-solving in an organization.</p>


## Experimentation and Innovation

<p>Exploration and Experimentation are intrinsic to our work, from day to day tasks to organizational conducts. By encouraging experiments, we foster a culture of research that defines who we are as an organization. What works is retained and reproduced and what doesn’t is yet another lesson learned.</p>
<p>Innovation thrives when we continuously experiment and challenge ourselves. So as we ensure experimentation, we inherently encourage innovation.</p>


## Co-Creation and Participation

<p>We believe in collaborating, co-creating and engaging communities to drive sustainable changes in the society. Engaging with people bring diverse perspectives and help us get timely feedback, along with constructive criticism. Moreover, it also gives an opportunity to replicate, retune and scale our solutions across geographies and sectors. Thus, we work to leverage communities in all our interventions to learn and grow together.</p>


## Empathy and Trust

<p>We understand that at times things won’t go our way and our interventions will not follow the path we envisioned. None shall stop us from being empathetic towards people we work with. Civic-tech is challenging and requires a lot of social and technical experimentation where mistakes are bound to happen, but being patient and calm towards situations is what we value. We believe that mistakes are as important as any other resource we acquire as a team and indeed they help us get better, wiser and kinder.</p>


## Fun and Engaging

<p>Dealing with complex social issues can sometimes become a bit overwhelming, but we still take our time to enjoy and share moments of rejoice. We believe that having fun activities like hanging out, playing games, eating food and travelling together not only helps us know each other better but also motivates and reduces stress. Since most of us work from different locations we keep finding innovative ways to engage and bond together.</p>
