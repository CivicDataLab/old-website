position: Front End Engineer

type: Full Time

brief: |
  We’re hiring a Frontend Engineer who specializes in building User Interfaces for data platforms. They will work alongside data strategists, public policy researchers and other stakeholders to develop platforms that help citizens participate and engage in discussions and assist policy-makers and researchers in working with public datasets. 


responsibilities: |

  As a team we’re moderately federated and our work is defined by the sectors we operate in. Public Finance, Law &amp; Justice and Urban Local governance are a few sectors where we’re actively engaging with our collaborators. The outputs, outcomes and future opportunities are always as per the needs, requirements, partnerships and opportunities available at a sector level.

  This structure also helps us find, share and validate our ideas across sectors. A good example here is the Open Budgets India platform, which we created to curate all important public finance data at one place. Our learnings here help us in creating the Justice Hub, which is a collaborative data platform for curating legal datasets.

  As a _Frontend Engineer_

  - You will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team to ideate and develop similar platforms across projects and sectors 
  - Work with our partners and build systems to express their findings for better advocacy purposes
  - Create more open tools for the community that simplifies the workflows on dealing with open &amp; public datasets

skills:
  - __A good command of Javascript__ - We have used several systems in the past to build UIs. But one thing that was common in most of our projects was Javascript. Experience with working on multiple frameworks is a plus, but what is essential and important is a good understanding of plain vanilla Javascript.

  - __Taking ownership of your ideas and work__ - We’re a small &amp; a remote team. As a member of CDL, you’ll have multiple opportunities to sign up for different projects (both internal and external) and wear multiple hats. We encourage you to work on issues that you associate with and help as a team to work around it. The most valuable skill you bring to this role is how you deal with these opportunities. We don’t follow a hierarchical structure and acting responsibly in whatever you sign up, is not only essential it also helps the team move forward.

good_to_have:
  
  - Working experience with React, ES6, HTML5, CSS3.
  - Conceptualisation of design into code using data visualisation libraries like D3, NVD3 etc. 
  - Understanding of handling and manipulating diverse datasets.
