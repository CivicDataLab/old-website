### About the Organization

CivicDataLab works with the goal to use data, tech, design and social science to strengthen the course of civic engagements in India. We work to harness the potential of open-source movement to enable citizens to engage better with public reforms. We aim to grow data and tech literacy of governments, nonprofits, think-tanks, media houses, universities etc to enable data-driven decision making at scale.
